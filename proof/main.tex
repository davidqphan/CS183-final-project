\begin{theorem}
Let f: A $\rightarrow$ B be a function. \vskip 0.1cm \noindent
Define R := $\{(a,b) \textrm{ $|$ } a,b \in A \textrm{ and } f(a) = f(b) \}$ Prove that R is transitive.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose (a,b), (b,c) $\in$ R. Then f(a) = f(b) and f(b) = f(c) such
	that f(a) = f(c). 
\end{proof}

\subsection{ELI5}
\begin{theorem}
Let f: A $\rightarrow$ B be a grading function.\vskip 0.1cm \noindent
Define R:= $\{(Joel, David), (David,Nick) \textrm{ $|$ } f(Joel) =
	f(David), f(David) = f(Nick)\}$ where f(Joel) = 'A'.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since Joel knows David. David has an 'A'. Therefore Nick also has an 'A' by the
transitive law.
\end{proof}
