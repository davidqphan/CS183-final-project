\subsection{Architecture}
\subsubsection{Design Overview}
Through our topology we have upgraded from an all layer 2 network to a 
combination of layer 2 and layer 3. Thus allowing for a more robust and "smart" 
network. With the implementation of layer 3 we have added routers to control 
the boardcast signals that were not controlled within the previous network. We
have added redundancy to the network allowing multiple connection points. To 
control the restrictions we have upgraded the network with VLANs. Thus ensuring
isolated departments and services by dividing them into separate VLANs.
