\subsection{VPN}
To allow our large sales department to access the webserver internally and
externally, we are using a VPN. It provides a secure and reliable private 
connection between computer networks over an existing public network.
There are two components required in our remote-access VPN configuration:
\begin{itemize}
	\item network access server: a user can connect to the NAS from the
		Internet with the proper valid credentials to sign in to the
		VPN.
	\item client software: in order to establish and maintain a connection
		to the VPN. It sets up the tunneled connection to the NAS,
		which the user indicates by its Internet address. Most
		operating systems have built-in software that can connect to
		remote access VPNs.
\end{itemize}
