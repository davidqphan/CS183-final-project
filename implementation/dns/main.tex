\subsection{Domain Name Server}
Implementation for Domain Name Server (DNS) on the new network upgrade has 
been outsourced for a cost of \$30,000. \\

\noindent
The expectation of the DNS implementation is that it provides the correct 
configuration to make references to various hosts on the network by sub/domain 
names as well as zones.
