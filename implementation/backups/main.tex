\subsection{Backups} \label{backups}
Backups for Acme Corp. are handled by a dedicated server that periodically 
backs up the disk storage of the NFS server throughout the day on onto a RAID 
storage system.

\subsubsection{Network/Interface Information}
\textbf{Network Gateway} \\
The backup server itself connects to the network through Fa0/6 of Switch 6 and 
is a member of the Acme Corp. "Server Zone". The default gateway for the backup 
server is the static IP for Fa0/6 on the \textbf{10.1.10.0/24} subnet, TBD. \\

\noindent
\textbf{IP Address} \\
The backup server is a member of the Internal Services ("Server Zone"), and is
likewise configured on subnet \textbf{10.1.160.x}, with a static IP address of 
\textbf{10.1.160.6}. \\

\subsubsection{Server Setup/Configuration}
The backup server is configured to periodically login to the NFS server and
backup the contents of the \lstinline$/home$ directory via a cron job. \\

\noindent
Backups are created twice a day, using crontab and a job for rsync as shown: \\

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor=\color{Gray}]
 0 3,15 * * * rsync -az -e 'ssh' backups@10.1.160.5:/home /home --delete
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{1em}
* passwordless login to the NFS server is possible using an RSA-pair SSH key.
** backups are performed at 3am and 3pm, times at which business impact will 
be minimal in case of nework lag.
